# FIXME 0.11: in 0.11, we should change the export filter to only export
# _gst_foo, but not __gst_foo (we can't change this now, since we added
# __gst_debug_min and __gst_debug_enabled at some point and need to keep
# ABI compatibility).  So below we special-case some symbols that shouldn't
# really be exported, either because we're too lazy to rename them to something
# that's not exported (like the _gst_parse_* stuff) or because we had them in
# public headers at some point although they shouldn't be and so we need to
# keep them exported now (like _gst_debug_init, 
# __gst_element_factory_add_interface or
# __gst_element_factory_add_static_pad_template).  We suppress them here to
# make sure they're at least not exported in the windows msvc build (they
# were never in the .def file, so they never got exported).
# _end is special cased because for some reason it is reported as an exported
# BSS symbol, unlike on linux where it's a local absolute symbol.
