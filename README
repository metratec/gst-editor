Overview
========

This is an unofficial fork of the abandoned [gst-editor](https://code.google.com/archive/p/gst-editor/)
project.

gst-editor is a pipeline editor for GStreamer, a framework for streaming media.
The fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon Graduate
Institute, as well as some ideas from DirectMedia.  It's based on plug-ins
that will provide the various codec and other functionality.  The
interface hopefully is generic enough for various companies (ahem, Apple)
to release binary codecs for Linux, until such time as they get a clue and
release the source.

The goal of this fork is to port gst-editor to Gtk+ 3 and GStreamer 1.0.
Currently, gst-editor will build with Gtk+ 3.10.8 or later and
GStreamer 1.2.4 or later.

* Loading and saving pipelines is currently disabled until
  a replacement for `GstXML` has been found or written.
