GStreamer Pipeline Editor "Si Senor!" 0.8.0 released

   A new release of the GStreamer graphical pipeline editor, gst-editor,
   containing various fixes and enhancements.

   The GStreamer editor allows users to assemble pipelines using the
   elements of GStreamer. It is useful for anyone interested in finding
   out more about how [1]GStreamer works, and particularly those people
   interested in prototyping a potential GStreamer pipeline. Find out
   more information about the gst-editor from the project's [2]home
   page.

   Although the editor is generally stable for small pipelines and such,
   it should be regarded as highly experimental code. Of course, bugs
   that can be pinned on the editor should be reported to [3]Gnome
   bugzilla.

  For a complete list of changes, see the ChangeLog file in the release tarball.

Download

   The gst-editor requires a GStreamer core of version 0.7.1 or higher.
